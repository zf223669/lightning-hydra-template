"""
This file contains the functions that encode the words in the JSON transcriptions using BERT.

The main differences between the two embeddings are:
    - the dimensionalities (768 vs 300)
    - BERT encodes the words using the entire sentence as a context

We expect that the JSONs were create with 10 FPS.

For each frame, we calculate 5 extra features in addition to the word encodings. See extract_extra_features() for details.
